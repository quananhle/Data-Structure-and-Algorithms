## Missing Number

```{python}
    def missingNumber(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
```

Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from ```0, 1, 2, ..., n``` find the one that is missing from the array.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [3,0,1]
Output: 2
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
```
**Note:** The algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity.
