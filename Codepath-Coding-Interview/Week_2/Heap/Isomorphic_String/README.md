## [205. Isomorphic Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings)

```Tag```:

#### Difficulty: Easy

Given two strings ```s``` and ```t```, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings ```s``` and ```t``` are isomorphic if the characters in ```s``` can be replaced to get ```t```.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.
